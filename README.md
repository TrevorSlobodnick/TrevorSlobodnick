- Hi, I’m Trevor, an aspiring web developer
- Some of my favorite things to do include:
     - playing video games
     - making people laugh
     - watching tv or enjoying a movie night
     - staying up late
- I’m currently expanding my knowledge in web development by creating projects, as well as learning the basics to investing, and tutoring a variety of programming courses at my college.
- Although I mainly work on websites, I have also had a lot of fun working on other small projects, like:
     - making desktop applications using javafx
     - making games using the libgdx java library/framework
     - making minecraft mods for the java edition of the game
     - making discord bots using python
