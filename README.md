- Hi, I’m Trevor!
- I have about 4 years of experience with building websites. I’m currently expanding my knowledge in web development by doing side projects for friends/family or building web applications to solve real world problems.
- I worked part time as a tutor at St Clair College tutoring students in a variety of different courses that relate to programming. I have tutored classes that focus on programming languages like JavaScript, PHP, C#, Java. I have also tutored courses that focus on the best practices in web, such as mobile web design and intro to web courses where students learn how to write HTML and CSS as well as best practices.
- I have experience with the following technologies:
     - HTML/CSS/Javascript
     - React
     - React Native
     - PHP
     - WordPress
     - MySQL
     - JQuery
     - Git/Github
- Although I mainly work on websites, I have also had a lot of fun working on other small projects, like:
     - making desktop applications using javafx
     - making mobile applications using React Native
     - making games in a variety of languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, Godot)
     - making minecraft mods for the java edition of the game
     - making Discord bots
- I’m always looking for new experiences, whether that be a job position or a new project to work on, my inbox is always open!
